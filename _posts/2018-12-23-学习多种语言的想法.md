I live in wuhan china, a Small village , i love my family even though it is the time of lacking Resources and technology, i still have lots of happiness to share with my family and friends .  i wirte this blog try to use in english all for practicing english and to imporve my english wirting skills  <br>

I know it is a little bit of difficulty for me using in english and even will make a lots of mistakes in wirting  but i do not care , i just want to use english all of my life <br>

The english studying  it is part of  my life , after i knowing that , the people life it is a process of growing up, so i want to do something it is different of other, what is the purpose of our living in the world?  in china , for partens for family for children and so on ... it is a bit tried of living this world for all this responsibilities.<br>

We are talk about language learing ,  i am poor code programmer cause i still have lost more to learn, i have been studying java scala python and go , in fact , there are some reasons for my learning those programm languages.<br>

The first one is high salary，secondly is bigdata to deal with those languages will be effective, i want to do some more interesting thing ,using more data to analysis and get more useful data to apply in life ... although it is far away for me , i have no chance to use my knowledge to deal with those datas, so in one day, i hope i could work alibaba or some great company like that, yes i did not have good education and go to a good University,  but i think the most good university it is ourself , the ablity to using internet to study the subject you interest in and Keep doing one thing you want to do in the world unless you are not living the world!<br>

Just like Steve Jobs once said "Stay Hungry Stay Foolish", we live this world just for doing something instead of doing nothing, i want doing something, some interesting things some things that can implements our work and dreams.
